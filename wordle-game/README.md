## Description 📑

This is a Worlee Game designed using Java Script. 
I have developed it in different phases:
- Grid Construction and Attempt Detection
- Keyboard Construction and Functions
- Selection of a random word
- Manual Cell Selection
- Enter and Back functions
After each phase, the code was refactored and organized to improve its structure and readability.
